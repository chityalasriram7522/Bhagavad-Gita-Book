             <p>The Bhagavad Gita, or the song of God, was revealed by Lord Shree Krishna to Arjun on the threshold of the epic war of Mahabharata. A decisive battle between two sets of cousins, the Kauravas and the Pandavas, was just about to commence on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. A detailed account of the reasons that led to such a colossal war; is given under Introduction-The Setting of the Bhagavad Gita.<br><br>

The Bhagavad Gita is primarily a conversation between Lord Shree Krishna and Arjun. However, the first chapter begins with a dialogue between King Dhritarashtra and his minister Sanjay. Dhritarashtra being blind, could not leave his palace in Hastinapur but was eager to know the ongoings of the battlefield.<br><br>

Sanjay was a disciple of Sage Ved Vyas, the author of the epic Mahabharata and several other Hindu scriptures. Sage Ved Vyas possessed a mystic ability to see and hear events occurring in distant places. He had bestowed upon Sanjay the miraculous power of distant vision. Therefore, Sanjay could see and hear, what transpired on the battleground of Kurukshetra, and gave a first-hand account to King Dhritarashtra while still being in his palace.<br><br></p>

                <p>Duryodhan said: Respected teacher! Behold the mighty army of the sons of Pandu, so expertly arrayed for battle by your own gifted disciple, the son of Drupad.</p><br>
                <h5 style="color: goldenrod;background-color: antiquewhite;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">Bhagavad Gita 1.4-1.6</h5>
                <p>Behold in their ranks are many powerful warriors, like Yuyudhan, Virat, and Drupad, wielding mighty bows and equal in military prowess to Bheem and Arjun. There are also accomplished heroes like Dhrishtaketu, Chekitan, the gallant King of Kashi, Purujit, Kuntibhoj, and Shaibya—all the best of men. In their ranks, they also have the courageous Yudhamanyu, the gallant Uttamauja, the son of Subhadra, and the sons of Draupadi, who are all great warrior chiefs</p><br>

                <p>Also, there are many other heroic warriors, who are prepared to lay down their lives for my sake. They are all skilled in the art of warfare, and equipped with various kinds of weapons.</p><br>
                <h5 style="color: goldenrod;background-color: antiquewhite;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">Bhagavad Gita 1.10</h5>
                <p>The strength of our army is unlimited and we are safely marshalled by Grandsire Bheeshma, while the strength of the Pandava army, carefully marshalled by Bheem, is limited</p><br>
                <h5 style="color: goldenrod;background-color: antiquewhite;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">Bhagavad Gita 1.11</h5>
                <p>Therefore, I call upon all the generals of the Kaurava army now to give full support to Grandsire Bheeshma, even as you defend your respective strategic points.</p><br>

                <p>Then, the grand old man of the Kuru dynasty, the glorious patriarch Bheeshma, roared like a lion, and blew his conch shell very loudly, giving joy to Duryodhan.

                <h5 style="color: goldenrod;background-color: antiquewhite;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">Bhagavad Gita 1.13</h5>
                <p>Thereafter, conches, kettledrums, bugles, trumpets, and horns suddenly blared forth, and their combined sound was overwhelming.</p><br>
                <h5 style="color: goldenrod;background-color: antiquewhite;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">Bhagavad Gita 1.14</h5>
                <p>Then, from amidst the Pandava army, seated in a glorious chariot drawn by white horses, Madhav and Arjun blew their Divine conch shells.</p><br>

                <h5 style="color: goldenrod;background-color: antiquewhite;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">Bhagavad Gita 1.19</h5>
                <p>The terrific sound thundered across the sky and the earth, and shattered the hearts of your sons, O Dhritarasthra</p><br>

                <p>At that time, the son of Pandu, Arjun, who had the insignia of Hanuman on the flag of his chariot, took up his bow. Seeing your sons arrayed against him, O King, Arjun then spoke the following words to Shree Krishna.</p><br>

                <p>nephews, grand-nephews, friends, fathers-in-law, and well-wishers.

                <h5 style="color: goldenrod;background-color: antiquewhite;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">Bhagavad Gita 1.29-1.31</h5>
                <p>My whole body shudders; my hair is standing on end. My bow, the Gāṇḍīv, is slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning all over. My mind is in quandary and whirling in confusion; I am unable to hold myself steady any longer. O Krishna, killer of the Keshi demon, I only see omens of misfortune. I do not foresee how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle.</p><br>
                <h5 style="color: goldenrod;background-color: antiquewhite;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">Bhagavad Gita 1.32-1.33</h5>
                <p>O Krishna, I do not desire victory, kingdom, or the happiness accruing to it. Of what avail will be a kingdom, pleasures, or even life itself, when the very persons for whom we covet them, are standing before us for battle?</p><br>
                <h5 style="color: goldenrod;background-color: antiquewhite;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">Bhagavad Gita 1.34-1.35</h5>
                <p>Teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, grandsons, fathers-in-law, grand-nephews, brothers-in-law, and other kinsmen are present here, staking their lives and riches. O Madhusudan, I do not wish to slay them, even if they attack me. If we kill the sons of Dhritarashtra, what satisfaction will we derive from the dominion over the three worlds, what to speak of this Earth?</p><br>
                <h5 style="color: goldenrod;background-color: antiquewhite;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">Bhagavad Gita 1.36-1.37</h5>
                <p>O Maintainer of all living entities, what pleasure will we derive from killing the sons of Dhritarasthra? Even though they may be aggressors, sin will certainly come upon us if we slay them. Hence, it does not behoove us to kill our own cousins, the sons of Dhritarashtra, and friends. O Madhav (Krishna), how can we hope to be happy by killing our own kinsmen?</p><br>
                <h5 style="color: goldenrod;background-color: antiquewhite;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">Bhagavad Gita 1.38-1.39</h5>
                <p>Their thoughts are overpowered by greed and they see no wrong in annihilating their relatives or wreaking treachery upon friends. Yet, O Janardan (Krishna), why should we, who can clearly see the crime in killing our kindred, not turn away from this sin?</p><br>
                <h5 style="color: goldenrod;background-color: antiquewhite;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">Bhagavad Gita 1.40</h5>
                <p>When a dynasty is destroyed, its traditions get vanquished, and the rest of the family becomes involved in irreligion.</p><br>
                <h5 style="color: goldenrod;background-color: antiquewhite;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">Bhagavad Gita 1.41</h5>
                <p>With the preponderance of vice, O Krishna, the women of the family become immoral; and from the immorality of women, O descendent of Vrishni, unwanted progeny are born.</p><br>
                <h5 style="color: goldenrod;background-color: antiquewhite;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">Bhagavad Gita 1.42</h5>
                <p>An increase in unwanted children results in hellish life both for the family and for those who destroy the family. Deprived of sacrificial offerings, the ancestors of such corrupt families also fall.s</p><br>
                <h5 style="color: goldenrod;background-color: antiquewhite;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">Bhagavad Gita 1.43</h5>
                <p>Through the evil deeds of those who destroy the family tradition and thus give rise to unwanted progeny, a variety of social and family welfare activities are ruined.</p><br>
                <h5 style="color: goldenrod;background-color: antiquewhite;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">Bhagavad Gita 1.44</h5>
                <p>O Janardan (Krishna), I have heard from the learned that those who destroy family traditions dwell in hell for an indefinite period of time.</p><br>
                <h5 style="color: goldenrod;background-color: antiquewhite;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">Bhagavad Gita 1.45-1.46</h5>
                <p>Alas! How strange it is that we have set our mind to perform this great sin with horrifying consequences. Driven by the desire for kingly pleasures, we are intent on killing our own kinsmen. It would be better if, with weapons in hand, the sons of Dhritarashtra kill me unarmed and unresisting on the battlefield.</p><br>
                <h5 style="color: goldenrod;background-color: antiquewhite;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">Bhagavad Gita 1.47</h5>
                <p>Sanjay said: Speaking thus, Arjun cast aside his bow and arrows, and sank into the seat of his chariot, his mind in distress and overwhelmed with grief.</p><br>
